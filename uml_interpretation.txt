List of errors in the uml:
- Aircraft uses the "implements" arrow notation to Flyable (which is described as an abstract class, not an interface)
- Aircraft does not declare a "updateConditions" method (required since it is declared as abstract in Flyable, and Aircraft is not marked as abstract itself)
- Helicopter, JetPlan and Baloon all declare the methods "updateConditions" as if they where extending Flyable directly (see Aircraft error above)
- String are lower case and missing * when used as parameter (IMO, Strings should use the same notation as any object)

Possible of solutions:
- Make Aircraft abstract (solves errors 2 and 3, minimal uml change) (I will chose this solution)
- Make flyable an interface and implement it on Helicopter, JetPlan and Baloon (solves errors 1, 2 and 3, but changes the uml layout)
